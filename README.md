## Sharpen your "Architecture Documentation" Saw: Architectural Decision Records (ADR) and Diagrams-as-Code

All solutions implicitly have an architecture, ideally one which is both intentional and documented. The Architectural Decision Records (ADR) process distributes architectural decision-making across team members. Accelerate the time-consuming process of hand drawing diagrams by rendering from a text-based source. Communicate effectively by committing both your markdown-based ADRs and text-based diagrams into your source code repository. This talk will review these techniques, provide actionable steps to adoption, and even live-code some examples.

### Example files

- ADR examples for choosing a diagramming tool under `adr`
